The prompt provided an `.mp3` file Our goal was to identify the **courthouse** where the case was heard.

## Solution

### Step 1: Identifying the Song
- First, I downloaded the `.mp3` file provided in the challenge. To identify the song title, I used **Shazam**, a popular app for recognizing music based on audio. Shazam revealed that the song was **"Blurred Lines" (feat. J BALVIN & Pharrell)**.

### Step 2: Researching the Court Case
- Knowing the song title, I reviewed the challenge description again, which hinted at finding details about a legal case involving this song. I used **"Blurred Lines lawsuit"** as a keyword in my searches to locate news articles covering the lawsuit, which provided information on the legal proceedings.

### Step 3: Finding the Courthouse
- Through my research, I noticed that various articles mentioned different names or descriptions for the courthouse involved. After some trial and error and examining multiple sources, I found an article that referenced the specific name of the courthouse where the case was held.
